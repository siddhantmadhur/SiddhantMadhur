# Hi, I'm @SiddhantMadhur

## About Me
#### I like programming and love learning new things every day. My speciality is web dev, where I am comfortable using Next.Js or Astro as frameworks for dynamic and static sites respectively. I am very familiar with Java and Python for problem-solving and am in the process of self-learning GoLang of creating REST APIs. My goal is to pursue a degree and career in Computer Science. I have certificates from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/siddhantmadhur) that showcase the diverse languages I have learned or looked at.

## My Tech Stacks
A recently tried tech stack that I've really enjoyed working with is the T3 stack (Next.js, Typescript, tRPC, Prisma, and NextAuth) as it's helped me bootstrap projects much much faster

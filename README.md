# Hi, I'm @SiddhantMadhur

I am a University of California, Santa Cruz student with a deep passion for Computer Science. In my free time, I like to develop many projects, including a Type Racer, a command-line interface tool to manage my projects, and a video streaming client for JellyFin. I am skilled at JavaScript, and Golang and am in the process of learning Rust for building Linux Daemons.

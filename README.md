# Hi, I'm @SiddhantMadhur

## About Me
#### I like programming and love learning new things every day. My speciality is web dev, where I am comfortable using Next.Js/React or Astro as frameworks for dynamic and static sites. I am very familiar with Java and Python for problem-solving and am in the process of self-learning GoLang and creating REST APIs. My goal is to pursue a degree and career in Computer Science. I have certificates from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/siddhantmadhur) that showcase the diverse languages I have learned or looked at.

## My Tech Stacks
A recently tried tech stack that I've really enjoyed working with is the T3 stack (Next.js, Typescript, tRPC, Prisma, and NextAuth) as it's helped me bootstrap projects much faster. But for projects where I'd like to be more hands-on, for performance or cost-based reasons, I really enjoy using plain React with a Golang backend.
